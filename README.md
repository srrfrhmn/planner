This obsidian vault is my preferred system to help track and manage tasks, projects, finances, and more all in one place. It is built on Obsidian’s note-taking and linking features and grounded in the “File over app” philosophy. It provides a clear structure and workflow that helps me stay focused on my tasks.

## Overview

- **Project Organization**  
	At the root, there is 1 `meta` directory. This is where I place my templates, as well as a small section about the goal of the vault in the `main` subdirectory. Each major initiative (personal or work-related) gets its own dedicated root directory. When needed, a directory may have a root note, denoted by a prefixed `_`. When there are multiple directories, and there is a need to order them, the directories have a number prefix.

- **Themes & Plugins**  
	My preferred themes are Minimal and Things. The Minimal theme included in this vault has tweaked headers to make the headers larger and more distinguishable. This vault also contains the CSV Table plugin.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or Download**  
    Place the vault folder within your Obsidian workspace. Open it in Obsidian to get started.

2. **Explore the Vault**  
	Familiarize yourself with the folder structure system. You’ll find dedicated sections for Projects, Tasks, Finances, and more.

3. **Customize Your Workflow**  
	Adapt the templates and note-taking strategies to your preferences. Link daily notes to tasks or projects for easy navigation.

5. **Extend Functionality**  
	Leverage Obsidian community plugins (e.g., Kanban, Calendar, Dataview) to further enhance your planning system. Tailor the vault to fit your needs.

## Notes

I’ve found that platforms like Notion are too bloated for my use case. I don’t need the feature-heavy platform, as I often get distracted in planning. This vault is enough to cover most of my needs without the added complexity and learning curve. Everything is stored locally in Markdown files, preserving data independence and ensuring your information remains easy to retrieve and read. Nothing fancy.
